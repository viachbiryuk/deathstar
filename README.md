# Deathstar

Test application

## How to run

1. Make sure you have _docker_ and _docker-compose_ installed on your machine
2. Run `docker-compose up` in the application directory - this will spin up API on http://localhost:9001

## NB!
* .env file is committed on purpose to ease the demonstration process
* You can import _insomnia-workspace_ into your Insonmia workspaces to test API using GUI
